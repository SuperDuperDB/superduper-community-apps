# SuperDuperDB Examples & Use-Cases

Welcome to the SuperDuperDB Examples repository! Here, you'll find a collection of diverse use-cases showcasing the capabilities of SuperDuperDB, from notebook demos to full-fledged applications.

## Community Use-Cases

### [Building a Semantic Search Engine](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduper-community-apps/tree/main/apps/ecommerce_semantic_search_app)

This Semantic Search Engine was developed with the following objectives:

- Utilizing Superduperdb to create a practical business use case of a vector database using MongoDB as the backend.
- Comparing the differences between a basic Semantic search engine and a simple Full-Text Search Engine.

**Basic Components Used:**
- **Backend:** MongoDB
- **Embedding:** OpenAI
- **Vector Search Functionality:** SuperduperDB
- **Frontend:** Streamlit


### [Implementing Chunked Vector Search with Multiple Inputs per Document](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduper-community-apps/blob/main/notebooks/chunked_vector_search.ipynb)

Let's find specific text within documents using vector-search. In this example, we show how to do vector-search. But here, we want to go one step further. Let's search for smaller pieces of text within larger documents. For instance, a developer may store entire documents but wants to find specific parts or references inside those documents.

Here we will show you an example with Wikipedia dataset. Implementing this kind of search is usually more complex, but with superduperdb, it's just one extra command.

Real-life use cases for the described problem of searching for specific text within documents using vector-search with smaller text units.

In each of these scenarios, the ability to efficiently search for and retrieve smaller text units within larger documents can significantly enhance data analysis and retrieval capabilities.

### [Image features](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduper-community-apps/blob/main/notebooks/resnet_features.ipynb)

#### Building an Image Feature Database in torchvision

In this example, we show how to utilize a pre-trained network from torchvision to produce image features. The images are automatically fetched and stored in MongoDB. We use a subset of the CoCo dataset (https://cocodataset.org/#home) to illustrate the process.

Real-life use cases for creating a database of image features using a pre-trained network in torchvision:

Use Case: Enhance image search capabilities in e-commerce platforms.
How: Generate image features for products using a pre-trained network. Store these features in a database for efficient image retrieval, making it easier for users to find similar products.
Content-Based Recommendation Systems:

Use Case: Improve content recommendations in media streaming services.
How: Extract image features from movie or show frames. Store these features in a database to recommend content with similar visual characteristics to users based on their preferences.
Facial Recognition in Security Systems:

Use Case: Strengthen facial recognition systems in security applications.
How: Utilize a pre-trained neural network to extract facial features from images. Store these features in a database for quick and accurate identification in security and surveillance scenarios.
Medical Image Analysis:

Use Case: Streamline image organization in photo libraries or social media platforms.
How: Extract features from uploaded images using a pre-trained model. Use these features to automatically generate relevant tags, making it easier for users to search and categorize their photos.
These use cases demonstrate how creating a database of image features using torchvision can be applied across various domains to enhance functionality and improve user experiences.

### [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduper-community-apps/blob/main/notebooks/sentiment_analysis_use_case.ipynb)
Sentiment analysis with transformers and SuperDuperDB

In this document, we're doing sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's transformers library. We demonstrate that you can perform this task seamlessly in SuperDuperDB, using MongoDB to store the data.

Sentiment analysis has some real-life use cases:

Customer Feedback & Review Analysis: Analyzing customer

 reviews and feedback to understand overall satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and respond to customer concerns. It is used in the E-commerce industry frequently.

Brand Monitoring: Monitoring social media, blogs, news articles, and online forums to gauge public sentiment towards a brand, product, or service. Addressing negative sentiment and capitalizing on positive feedback.

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and responding to opinions and emotions expressed across various domains, contributing to better decision-making and enhanced user experiences.

All of these can be done with your existing database and SuperDuperDB. You can integrate similar code into your ETL infrastructure as well. Let's see an example.
